# TinyFPGA Programmer
The TinyFPGA Programmer is a very simple USB-JTAB bridge designed to 
program bitstreams onto TinyFPGA A1 and A2 boards.  

## Status
The project is currently in progress.  Initial schematic and PCBs have
been designed along with firmware for the USB microcontroller.  Biggest
task left is developing the Python libraries for interfacing with the
firmware and driving the JTAG interface.
